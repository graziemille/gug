I. A descriptive statement of the facts of your language. 

1. Adjectival and adverbial modifiers.

As stated in lab4, modifiers in Paraguayan Guaraní (hereafter PG or simply Guaraní), be they attributive adjectives or adverbs, have similar behaviors and forms. With adjectives, we recognize that there is no inflection agreement between adjectives and their nouns. Attributive adjectives immediately follow the nouns they modify. Similar to adjectives, adverbs immediately follow the verbs they modify, they also do not show any agreement with the verb they modify. 

In PG, it seems that nouns and verbs are very similar roots. Nominal roots can also have the function of predicates as verbal roots do, and nouns can get cross-referential markers the same way verbs do. This distinction of verbs and nouns, that might play a bigger role in languages like English, is blurred in PG. 

Although there may be words that are only used as adjectives or as adverbs because of their semantics, words that can be used for both categories seem to have the same form, with no morphological difference whatsoever between the two uses. Therefore in the application of our grammar   It seems that it makes sense to treat both adjectives and adverbs as one same lexical type. 

2. Possessives.

Paraguayan Guarani has a basic possessive construction of juxtapositon of two nouns to display their possessive relation. The first noun is the possessor. The second noun is the possessum. Semantically the possessor must possess the quality of being able to possess. 

There is an exemption for that we asses to be reasonable: only common nouns and proper nouns can be possessors or possessums.  That excludes pronouns from these constructions. We don't find possessive construction using personal pronouns in our sources. Also, as our testsuite currently does not implement proper nouns, we concentrated on the implementation with common nouns in this week's lab. 

Juxtaposition is also used for noun relations (e.g., to mean “with x”), but this phenomenon will not be analyzed this week as we are only concerned with possessives in this section.  

Keeping the basic order of possessor followed by possessum, there is also another possessive construction which employs a prefix (denoting the possessor) on a noun (possessum). Morphologically such prefixes are identical to markers we get on stative intransitive verbs.  We will try to be aware of this distinction and be explicit about sentence constructions that ambiguously could be interpreted in these both ways.  

Also we want to be aware that possessive construction with possessive prefixes cannot undergo a possessive construction as a possessum. This constraint is similar to the one on some common nouns that can’t be a possessum (e.g.'wind' in PG), whose solution should have similarities. 

Nouns in PG also exhibit different degrees of alienability depending of the semantics they contain, as we previously stated in lab 3. While the majority of nouns can optionally take the role of a possessum in a possessive construction, there are nouns where such a construction is obligatory. This applies especially to nouns that express kinship, parts of body, personal attributes or spatial relationships. These nouns can only exist in a possessive construction, either in simple juxtaposition, or with a possessive affix. This aspect of alienability and inalienability of nouns will not be resolved in this lab, although present in one of our testsuite examples.

3. Definiteness and other aspects of discourse status.

We are able to identify the overt use of definite determiners and personal pronouns in our data as syntactically present elements that express some kind of definiteness. In general, it seems that PG does not make a wide use of definiteness, and the use of the determiners just optionally constrains a more common underspecification on the semantics of the noun. The existence of the determiners la/lo for singular and plural are a borrowing from Spanish. They are not consistently used in sentences which express the definiteness of nouns and their absence is not an expression of indefiniteness.  An uninflected argument in a sentence can be definite or indefinite just depending on the context in which it is being expressed. Determiners nevertheless establish some uniqueness, familiarity or active presence of a noun, so we will try to implement their cognitive status. 

Personal pronouns are also another word class that gets a classification for its cognitive status. They represent situationally relevant arguments of a predicate and express therefore some degree of specificity. As pronouns often in context often reference and substitute for noun phrases, nouns, or even full sentences, they exist in a syntactically or contextually rich situation, which allows them sometimes to be dropped. In such  cases of argument optionality (next section),  it therefore important to keep some record of a cognitive status that is relevant in the discourse. The grammar should be able to track those elements in the semantics of the predicates.

4. Argument optionality

PG allows for argument optionality in contextually rich situations, where the semantics of missed arguments are preserved in the context although not expressed syntactically. Some sources suggested that animacy played a role in argument drop, but a recent paper by Judith Tonhauser, cites corpus data to suggest that it is not quantifiably true that argument optionality is based on animacy/gender of PG nouns. 

Argument drop is syntactically supported by the systematic use of cross-referential markers on predicates, which facilitate the interpretation of dropped arguments. The cross-referential markers only represent either the subject or object argument of a predicate at a given time, but due to the rules and hierarchy they represent, they also point to limitations imposed on the argument not marked. This was already expressed in lab 2 and 3. This system or markings has been already implemented in our grammar and will not further discussed here, as we want to concentrate in the cognitive status of dropped arguments. 

Semantically, our sources suggest that context plays an important role in the semantic construction of dropped arguments, and therefore we will follow an interpretation of 'definite null instantiation', simply DNI, for our dropped arguments. As PG is a language that accepts different orders of sentence constituents, and therefore arguments might be dropped at different locations of a sentence, it is important that parses are sufficiently ambiguous to represent the different combinations of S, V, and O arguments, when the subject, the object or both might have been dropped. At the end, getting the equivalent semantic representation in our MRS will determine the correctness of the analysis. 

5. Anything else.

As we are dealing with possessives this week, we decided to include a phenomenon characteristic of PG. PG exhibits a group of nouns that resist being possessums in possessive construction, being those mostly words denoting natural things like wind, the sun, plants. These nouns cannot undergo possessive juxtapositions with another noun (as the possessum), nor can they have a pronoun prefix that indicates being owned or part something or somebody else. It seems that the implementation could be rather simple. 

Additionally, as we deal with adjectives in this lab, we wanted to secure that adjectives cannot be the modifiers of pronouns, as we don't have any sentences that attest such use of adjectives.  Additionally we implemented the phenomenon that adjectives cannot be modifiers to pronouns. Pronouns are in our documentation elements that do not take modifiers. Therefore we wanted to make sure that such a constrain is implemented.

Finally, as we worked with argument optionality in this lab, we decided to clean the way that some of our parses were being generated, and some spurious over-generation resulting from the order of  head-subj/subj-head and head-comp/comp-head and the argument optionality rules. This involved looking for wrong parses, overgeneration, and or missing parses. 


II. Illustrative IGT examples from your testsuite.

1. Adjectival and adverbial modifiers.

Adjectives and adverbs follow the words they modify. This is illustrated for attributive adjectives and adverbs with the following IGTs: 

#Ex.169: Use of adjective as an attribute of the object of verb predicate
Source: author
Vetted: f

Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {adv, wo}
aguata pya'e
aguata pyaHe
a-guata pyaHe
1SG-walk quick
'I walk quickly'

Therefore it is ungrammatical to have adjectives or adverbs preceding the words they modify.

#Ex.170: Attributive adjetive before a noun is wrong position
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: adj
tuicha vakaA ahecha
tuicha vakaA ahecha
tuicha vakaA a-hecha
O.3-big cow.ANIM A.1SG-see 
*'I see the big cow'

#Ex.155: Adverb in wrong position, should be after the verb predicate
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: adv
pya'e aguata
pyaHe aguata
pyaHe a-guata
quickly 1SG-walk
*'I walk quickly'

As we appreciate from these examples, there is no agreement between noun and adjective. A sentence fragement like 'mitaN reiaHe', could mean in English 'the happy child', 'a happy child', 'the happy children' or even 'happy children'. There is no special inflection in Guarani to mark this difference. It seems that context and the discourse use of words determine  the correct semantics of a sentence, if relevant for Guarani speakers at all. Also we note that in sentences 169 and 152, the same word 'tuicha', meaning 'big', is used but as an attributive adjective in the first one, and as an adverb in the second sentence. Their overt form  is the same. Their location is the same, being directly after the word they modify in the word order. Therefore we will implement their use in the grammar in a similar way by taking a general rule that applies to 'adjectives' (as a common name for adverbs and adjective) to both nouns and verbs. This will be further explained in section III. 

2. Possessives.

As mentioned in the previous section, there are two constructions used to express possessiveness: a simple juxtaposition and the use of prefixes. Here some examples of those, as they are present in our testsuite (IGTs 99 and 101):

#Ex.99: Noun Noun Possessives. Inanimate Possessor. Inanimate Alienable Possession.
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {poss, wo}
ahecha yvyra raka
ahecha yvyra raka
a-hecha yvyra raka
A.1SG-see tree  branch
'I see tree branches'

#Ex.101: Noun Noun Possessives. Human Possessor. Inanimate Alienable Possession.
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {poss, wo}
ahecha mbo'ehára roAga
ahecha mboHehaAra roAga
a-hecha mboHehaAra roAga
A.1SG-see professor   house
'I see the professor's house'

A reverse order of the arguments, while syntactically possible, is semantically limited. The possessor should be able to possess the possessum. In our examples, branches do not possess trees, nor houses possess a professor (apart from the effort to having a mortgage to pay). This semantic limitation is not dealt with in our grammar, as it is dependent on the semantics of the specific situation. Therefore we assume in general that all nouns can take the role of possessor in our grammar (with the exception of personal pronouns and prefix possessive constructions mentioned as stated in I.2). Ungrammatical therefore are examples like the following:

#Ex.171: Pronouns cannot be part of possessive constructions
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: 
Phenomena: poss
ahecha ha'e yvyra
ahecha haHe yvyra
a-hecha haHe yvyra
A.1SG-see A.3.pron tree
*'I see his tree'

#Ex.172: Pronouns cannot be part of possessive constructions
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: u
Phenomena: poss
ahecha yvyra ha'e
ahecha yvyra haHe
a-hecha haHe yvyra
A.1SG-see tree A.3.pron
*'I see his tree'

The semantics of the above sentences cannot be reflected with a juxtapostion. The first sentance though, can be implemented with the other possessive construction that uses personal pronoun prefixes on the nouns. For example the following IGT's:

#Ex.102: Affix-marked Possessives. 
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: poss
ahecha iróga
ahecha iroAga
a-hecha i-roAga
A.1SG-see O.3-roAga
'I see her house'

As nouns can be also predicates in a sentence and use the same kind of markings for their arguments, there are ambiguous sentences like the following:

#Ex.140: Ambiguity between noun predict and possessive marker
Source: b
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: cop
chesy oguata
chesy oguata
che-sy o-guata
O.1SG-mother.ANIM A.3-walk
'My mother walks' / 'I am a mother and she walks'

In the first interpretation the noun is just a noun with a personal prefix followed by a verb predicate that uses that noun as its subject argument. In a second reading this is a conjuntion of two prediates (in simple juxtaposition). 


3. Definiteness and other aspects of discours status.

Determiners preceed the nouns they refer to. Here are two examples of the use of determiners in PG.

#Ex.1: Transitive verb agrees with 3Per subject. Singular determiners. Accusative case marking on the animate object.
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {wo, agr, c}
la ju'i ohecha la vakápe
la juHi ohecha la vakaApe
la juHi o-hecha la vakaA-pe
the.SG frog.ANIM.NOM A.3-see the.SG cow.ANIM-ACC
'The frog sees the cow'

#Ex.48: Dynamic intransitive agrees with 3PER subject. Plural determiner. SV word order.
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {det, wo, agr}
lo ju'i oguata
lo juHi oguata
lo juHi o-guata
the.PL frog.ANIM.NOM A.3-walk
'The frogs walk'

Neverthless, not using these determiners, just leaves the noun underspecified, with several possible translations in languages like English, where number and definiteness are still relevant.

#Ex.19: Dynamic intransitive verb agrees with 3rd subject. VS word order.
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: wo
oguata ju'i
oguata juHi
o-guata juHi
A.3-Walk frog.ANIM.NOM
'The frog walks' / 'A frog walks'/ 'The frogs walk' / 'Frogs walk'

Therefore when using a determiner ('lo' or 'la'), we have to restrict the cognitive status of the noun phrase it is involved in. This will be further discussed in section III.3.

Apart from determiners, we have also pronouns in PG as a word category that points to some specifity in the arguments of a discourse. Here some examples of their use in our testsuite:

#Ex.12: Dynamic intransitive verb agrees with 1SG subject. SV word order.
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {agr, pn}
che aguata
che aguata
che a-guata
I.NOM A.1SG-walk
'I walk'

#Ex.173: Transitive verb two personal pronoun arguments.

Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {agr, pn}
che ahecha chupe
che ahecha chupe
che a-hecha chupe
I.NOM A.1SG-see 0.3.pron.ACC
'I see him'

The cognitive status of such arguments should be represented according to the standards specified in our lab. This implementation is further explaines in III.4.

4. Argument optionality
Argument optionality, understood as the free option of the overt presense or absense of noun phrases that act as the arguments of a predicate, is common in PG, as it is visible in several of our sentences in the testsuite:

#Ex.57:  Dynamic intransitive verb agrees with 1SG subject marking. Subject dropped.
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: pro-d, agr
ajeroky
ajeroky
a-jeroky
A.1SG-dance
'I dance'

#Ex.61: Transitive verb. Completive aspect. Subject drop. Object drop.
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {agr, tam, pro-d}
ahendupa
ahendupa
a-hendu-pa
A.1SG-hear-COMPL
'I have heard (you/it/her/him/them) all'

#Ex.81: Transitive verb agrees with 1SG subject. Inanimate/nonhuman object drop.  Subject drop. 
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: pro-d
ahecha
ahecha
a-hecha
A.1SG-see
'I see (you/him/her/it/them)'

Currently our grammar captures in general the limitations impossed by the cross-reference markers of the predicate. In the sentence #57 the dropped subject argument is 1SG, the same for sentences 61 and 81. The dropped object of the transitive predicate in sentences 61 and 81 is underspecified, as a subject 1SG is the highest marker in the hierarchy, and therefore does not impose restrictions on dropped objects. This is not to be confused with reflexive predicate arguments, which are handled different in PG (further to this point in section VI.4). The pernum is underspecified for sentences 61 and 81. On the other side in sentences that use any other markers would include restrictions on the objects:

#Ex.174: Dropped argument on a transitive verb in 2nd person subject.
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {agr}
rehecha
rehecha
re-hecha
A.2SG-see
'You don't see (it/him/her/them)'

Our current grammar imposses the restriction that the object of this transitive predicate be 3rd person. Similarly, portmanteau markers implement other restrictions:

#Ex.175: Dropped argument on a transitive verb marked with a portmanteau marker.
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {agr}
pohecha
pohecha
po-hecha
A.1SG_2SG-see
'I see you(pl)'

This sentence is has the pernum restriction marked in its arguments, and therefore not ambiguous, even though the arguments are not overt as full NPs. The equivalent sentence with full NPs is:

#Ex.176: Transitive verb marked with a marker and full pronoun arguments.
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: {agr}
che ahecha ndeve
che ahecha ndeve
che a-heach ndeve
A.1.pron A.1SG_2SG-see 2.PL.pron.ACC
'I see you(pl)'

In the case of dropped pronouns arguments, ther pernum reference works as expected, but the object cognitive status is still underspecified before the beginning of the lab. While the subject arguments remain 'in-foc' after being dropped, the same is not originally applied to the grammer for the object arguments. This is implemented as in III.4.

5. Anything else.
--- Non-Possessor Nouns
Common-nouns like 'wind' don't accepts a possessor in PG. As shown in these IGTs

#Ex.108: Unmarked 'unpossessable' noun.
Source: author
Vetted: f
Judgment: g
Phenomena: poss
ahendu yvytu hata
ahendu yvytu hata

ahendu avatityA yvytu hata 
a-hendu avatityA yvytu hata
A.1SG-hear cornfield wind.INAM strong
*'I hear the cornfield's strong wind'

This constrain is limited to the constrain to be implemented for pronouns (which cannot be possessors nor possessums). Nevertheless, as seen below in III.5, they could jointly be implemented.

-- No adjective modifiers for pronouns
Aditionally, attribute adjectives cannot be modifiers of pronouns. So while this sentence 
is gramatical:

Phenomena: adj
ha'e reia'e oguata
haHe reiaHe oguata

3.SG.pron happy.NOM A.3-walk
*'Happy him walks'

The implementation is mentioned below in III.1.

-- Wrong parsing trees
We hade over- and undergeneration of some parses, due in part to the generous argument optionality built in our language, and its the free word order. This is not related to specific IGTs or theirexpressed ungrammaticallity, but were rather related to the grammar implementation. Therefore further details in III.5. We used though the following sentences to be sure that the different ambigous parsings were happening, which include the different SVO,SOV, VOS, VSO, OSV, OVS parses, as well as possessive juxtaposition of nouns:

III. A statement of how you implemented teh phenomenon in terms of types you added/modified and particular tdl contraints. That is, the actual tdl snippets with prose description around them.

NOTE: Unless otherwise specified, all tdl changes here were included in our paraguayan_guarani.tdl file.

1. Adjectival and advervial modifiers.

As the syntactic behaviour of attributive adjectives and adverbs is the same in most aspects, we decided to create rules that would include both arguments at the same time .  We verified that the right entry is found in rules tdl, which reflects that attibutive adjectives and adverbs follow the words they modify


head-adj-int := head-adj-int-phrase.

We changed the basic-intersective-adjective-lex which usually has a value 'ref-ind' for its XARG feature. This value refers to nouns. The more general 'event-or-ref-index' includes verbal and nominal elements, therefore more suitable for our purposes. We decided also to keep rules that were already instantiated for adjective as a general designation for adjectives and adverbs (just saving us some time). We added also the 'gug' reference in front of some rules, to express the exclusive use in our language. Therfore the adverb/adjective lex supertype looked as folows:

adj-lex := gug-intersective-adjective-lex.
gug-intersective-adjective-lex := basic-adjective-lex &
  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.XARG event-or-ref-index & #xarg,
           LKEYS.KEYREL.ARG1 #xarg ] ].

Additionally we had to make changes in teh attr-adj-lex. It originally looked as follows:

attr-adj-lex := adj-lex & intersective-mod-lex &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.MOD < [ LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD noun,
                                              VAL.SPR cons ] ] > ].

In this form, it allowed only noun as possible modifees. This was changed to a disjuntive type +nv which included adverbs. Also VAL.SPR as a restriction was taken, as verbs no longer have SPR values in this grammar.

attr-adj-lex := adj-lex & intersective-mod-lex &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.MOD < [ LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD +nv ] ] > ].

Also the attributive-adj-lex had to be adjusted to avoid some undesirable parses. 

attributive-adj-lex := attr-only-adj-lex &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ POSTHEAD +,
                       HEAD.MOD < [ LIGHT +,
                                    MODIFIED notmod ] > ] ].

As we wanted to secure that adverbs would not be able to attache to S, but just to VP, we included
[LIGHT +] as a value of HEAD.MOD, while the bare-np would include a [LIGHT -] contraint:

bare-np-phrase := basic-bare-np-phrase &
  [ SYNSEM.LIGHT -,
    C-CONT.RELS <! [ PRED "exist_q_rel" ] !> ].

The additional constrain in the [HEAD.MOD<MODIFIED notmod>] of the attributive-adj-lex  was built in order to limit the use of adjectives with pronouns. As its counterpart, the restriction of [MODIFIED hasmod] was added to the pron-noun-lex, so pronouns would not unify under the attributive-adj-lex.

pron-noun-lex := no-spr-noun-lex &
      [SYNSEM [ MODIFIED hasmod,
                LOCAL [CAT.HEAD.POSS -,
                     CONT.HOOK.INDEX [COG-ST activ-or-more, SPECI +]]]].

The other changes shown here for the pron-lex are related to sections below, but for completeness
the whole IGT is presented here.


2. Possessives

The juxtaposition of nouns was implemented with the tdl snipped supplied in the lab. The following tdl was added at the end of our paraguayan_guarani.tdl file:

poss-phrase := head-final &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD #head & [POSS poss-or-ee],
           VAL [ SPR < >,
           COMPS < >,
           SUBJ < > ] ],
    C-CONT [ HOOK.INDEX #index,
       RELS < ! arg12-ev-relation & [ PRED "poss_rel",
             LBL #lbl,
             ARG1 #index,
             ARG2 #poss ],
       quant-relation & [ PRED "exist_q_rel",
              ARG0 #index,
              RSTR #harg ] ! >,
       HCONS < ! qeq & [ HARG #harg, LARG #lbl ] ! >,
       ICONS < ! ! > ],
    HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD #head & [POSS poss-ee] & noun,
          VAL.SPR < [ ] > ],
          CONT.HOOK [ INDEX #index & [ COG-ST uniq+fam+act ],
          LTOP #lbl ] ],
    NON-HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD noun & [POSS poss-or],
              VAL.SPR < > ],
        CONT.HOOK.INDEX #poss ] ].

This tdl takes a NOM as its head-daughter (possessor) and an NP as non-head-daughter. It contributes also a quantifier (exist_q_rel) for the NOM adn the poss_rel via its C-CONT.RELS. The C-CONT.HOOK exposes the head -daughter's index. There were though an important change, a new feature for the type noun, the feature [POSS poss].

noun:+ [POSS poss].

poss := *top*.
non-poss := poss.
poss-or-ee := poss.
poss-or := poss-or-ee.
poss-ee := poss-or-ee.

This feature should help us to make distinction between some nouns that can or not be possessor or possessums. This feature was used in the juxtaposition rule from above. So the head daughter has to have the quality of being a possessum and the non-head daughter of being a possessor. 
The feature [POSS] has a additionally possible value [PSS non-poss]. This feature value helps us to not allow pronouns to go through the juxtaposition rule, as there would be no unification:

pron-noun-lex := no-spr-noun-lex &
      [SYNSEM [ MODIFIED hasmod,
                LOCAL [CAT.HEAD.POSS non-poss,
                     CONT.HOOK.INDEX [COG-ST activ-or-more, SPECI +]]]].

This would allow our desired behaviour to constrain ungrammtical sentences that combine adjective and pronouns under 
one NP.

Similarly we wanted to guarantee that certain words cannot be possessum but possessor. This is specilly true for our nous like 'wind'. The feature [POSS] with its value [POSS poss-or] would allow for nouns just to be in the position  of possessor or just imply alone (because not in a possessive construction). Therefore we created a lex type for some common-nouns, that would allow this. As we currently have only one inanimate common noun in this category ('wind'), this is the only supertype we would look at, but if the lexicon is expanded, the rule would have to be adjusted to include also animate nouns. So the lex-rule is as follows:

non-poss-com-noun-inam-lex := com-inam-noun-lex & 
        [SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.POSS poss-or].

In the lexical entry of 'wind', we redefined its supertype (lexicon.tdl):

yvytu := non-poss-com-noun-inam-lex &
  [ STEM < "yvytu" >,
    SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "_wind_n_rel" ].

Appart from the juxtaposition, we dealt also with personal pronoun prefixes and nouns ,as a second possessive construction in PG. For that purpose we had to create a new class positional of nouns, where possessive pronouns where possessive pronouns were encoded as affixes. The rule would inherit from one supertype 'infl-only-lex-rule'. The C-CONS.RELS and the C-CONT.HCONS of the rule had to be modeled on teh possessive pronouns that are already existent in our lexicon, but dropping the exist-Q-rel aht goes with the possessum, and the associated qeq in the HCONS. C-CONS.ICONS had to be empty. The daughter had to be a common-noun-lex. The following lex-rule was created:

poss-lex-rule-super := infl-add-only-lex-rule &
  [SYNSEM.LKEYS.ALTKEYREL #altkeyrel,
   DTR common-noun-lex & [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK [  INDEX #index,  
              LTOP #lbl  ] ,
            CAT [ HEAD.POSS poss-or ,
            VAL.SPR <[OPT +]> ] ]],   
  C-CONT [ HOOK [INDEX #index, 
            LTOP #lbl  ],
    RELS <! arg12-ev-relation &
          [ PRED "poss_rel",
            LBL #lbl,
            ARG1 #index,
            ARG2 #arg2 ],
          quant-relation &
          [PRED "exist_q_rep",
           ARG0 #arg2,
           RSTR #harg ],
          #altkeyrel & noun-relation &
            [PRED "pron_rel",
             LBL #lbl2,
             ARG0 #arg2 & [ COG-ST activ-or-more,
                SPECI + ] ] !>, 
  HCONS <! qeq & [ HARG #harg, 
       LARG #lbl2 ] !>,
  ICONS <! !>] ].

In order to avoid that words that undergo this prefix construction go again into a possessive construction as possessum, the mother has a [HEAD.POSS poss-or] value. This leads to the same situation we had before with nouns like 'wind' that cannot be possessed. 

Subtypes had to constrain the PNG value of the pron_rel:

1sg-poss-lex-rule := poss-lex-rule-super &
  [ SYNSEM.LKEYS.ALTKEYREL.ARG0.PNG.PERNUM 1SG ].

2sg-poss-lex-rule := poss-lex-rule-super &
  [ SYNSEM.LKEYS.ALTKEYREL.ARG0.PNG.PERNUM 2SG ].

3-poss-lex-rule := poss-lex-rule-super &
  [ SYNSEM.LKEYS.ALTKEYREL.ARG0.PNG.PERNUM 3rd ].

1pl-incl-poss-lex-rule := poss-lex-rule-super &
  [ SYNSEM.LKEYS.ALTKEYREL.ARG0.PNG.PERNUM 1PL_incl ].

1pl-excl-poss-lex-rule := poss-lex-rule-super &
  [ SYNSEM.LKEYS.ALTKEYREL.ARG0.PNG.PERNUM 1PL_excl ].

2PL-poss-lex-rule := poss-lex-rule-super &
  [ SYNSEM.LKEYS.ALTKEYREL.ARG0.PNG.PERNUM 2PL ].

Additionally some entries in the irules.tdl:

2sg-poss-prefix :=
%prefix (* nde)
2sg-poss-lex-rule.

3-poss-prefix :=
%prefix (* i)
3-poss-lex-rule.

1pl-incl-poss-prefix :=
%prefix (* nNande)
1pl-incl-poss-lex-rule.

1pl-excl-poss-prefix :=
%prefix (* ore)
1pl-excl-poss-lex-rule.

2pl-poss-prefix :=
%prefix (* pende)
2pl-poss-lex-rule.

3. Definiteness and other aspects of discours status.

As stated in I.3 and II.3 we target determiners and pronouns as the only elements in our current grammar that mark some reference to definitiveness. Following the recomendations and our current understanding of the grammar in PG, we included the follwing cognitive status to the supertype for determiners:

determiner-lex := basic-determiner-lex & basic-zero-arg & non-mod-lex-item &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL [ SPR < >,
                           COMPS < >,
                             SUBJ < >,
         SPEC<[LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.COG-ST uniq+fam+act]>]].

As mentioned before, determiners are a syntactic element not original in the Tupi-Guaraní languages, but rather the result of exposure to Spanish. We assume the suggested value uniq+fam+act. For determiners we leave also the SPECI value underspecified. 

In contrast to it, pronouns have a higher degree of specificity, therefore [SPECI +]. Otherwise we take the value 'activ-or-more' as the cognitive-status of pronouns, as equivalent to our understanding of what happens in PG according to our sources. Here the lexical entry for pronouns our tdl file for PG:

pron-noun-lex := no-spr-noun-lex &
      [SYNSEM [ MODIFIED hasmod,
                LOCAL [CAT.HEAD.POSS -,
                     CONT.HOOK.INDEX [COG-ST activ-or-more, SPECI +]]]].

Additionally, the cognitive status value of dropped arguments had to be completed. This is discussed in the next section III.4

4. Argument optionality

Our current grammar provides already bookkeeping of relevant information about dropped arguments of predicates. The cross-markers of verb predicates imposse restrictions in pernum values of subject and nouns, that even in the case of dropped NP arguments in a sentences, are kept as information in AVM of the predicates, and therefore reflectedin the MRS of those predicates.

The grammar also seem to provide already for a cognitive status value for dropped subject arguments, which is also acceptabel for our current understanding of PG grammer, at [COG-ST in-foc].

The grammar though doesn't provide for cognitive status value for the dropped object arguments of our transitive verbs. Therefore we made some changes in the transitive-verb-lex that would record that value.

transitive-verb-lex := verb-lex & transitive-lex-item & completive-aspect-or-perfective-aspect-or-prospective-aspect-rule-dtr & future-aspect-rule-dtr & neg1-rule-dtr & neg2-rule-dtr &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS < #comps & [OPT-CS in-foc]>,
    ARG-ST < [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD +np ],
             #comps &
             [ LOCAL.CAT [ VAL [ SPR < >,
                                 COMPS < > ],
                           HEAD +np ] ] >,
    INFLECTED.PERNUM-TRANS-FLAG - ].

This is reflected in the [OPT-CS infoc] value, which is taken in the basic-head-opt-compl-phrase rule as the cognitive value for dropped object parameters.


5. Anything else.

-- Non-possessor Nouns
Explained above in III.2.

-- No adjective modifiers for pronouns
Implemented above in III.1.

-- Wrong parses
We were having some overgeneration and parses that were not delivering the right parse.
We needed a head-sub/sub-head rule to be able to apply low (in order to get OSV/VSO) and also high to get SOV/VOS. So we needed a constrain to be added so that if the head-subj/sub-head is aplying low, then the complement is not optional. So we created with the help of our instructor a type nonlist, that would say [OPT -]:

nonolist := list.
nonocons := nonolist & cons &
  [ FIRST [ OPT - ],
    REST  nonolist ].
nononull := nonolist & null.

We then contrainte the COMPS value of head-daughter (or mother) of the head-sub/sub-head rules to be this nonlist:

gug-head-subj-phrase := decl-head-subj-phrase &
[ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL [COMPS nonolist] ].

head-subj-phrase := gug-head-subj-phrase & head-initial-head-nexus.

subj-head-phrase := gug-head-subj-phrase & head-final-head-nexus.


The first application of this new type had actually a 'unexpressed' element, which was also causing some ambiguous parsing not to occur (OSV was not happening, while SOV was parsing):

nonolist := list.
nonocons := nonolist & cons &
  [ FIRST unexpressed & [ OPT - ],
    REST  nonolist ].
nononull := nonolist & null.

Therefore the 'unexpressed' element was taken out in the final version, shown some lines above. 


IV. If the analysis is not fully working, a description of the problems you are encountering.

1. Adjectival and advervial modifiers.
Implementation is working accoding to the expectations of our analysis and data available.

2. Possessives
Implementation is working accoding to the expectations of our analysis and data available. We missed to be able to make the distinction between alienable and inaliebable nouns for the possessive constructions. After creating the Feature [POSS poss] used in our implementation above, we feel that in a coming week we might be closer to reflect the possibility in our sentences if time allows.

3. Definiteness and other aspects of discours status.
Implementation is working accoding to the expectations of our analysis and data available.

4. Argument optionality
Reflexives are not part of grammar, but nevertheless they slipped in the overgeneration of arguments that our transitive verbs can generate in some of the cross-marker combinations. Cross-markers on predicates do not limit perse reflexivity, but the grammar in PG has a distinctive way to mark the reflexive arguments and predicate with which they are related. As we are not dealing with reflexive predicates in this course, we will ignore the overgeneration, as this is in it self not a wrong behaviour of our predicate, but rather an underuse of proper markers that would make such a sentence complete.

5. Anything else.
Implementation is working accoding to the expectations of our analysis and data available.


V. Statement of the current overage of the grammar over your testsuite (using number you can get from Analyze|Coverage and Analyze|Overgeneration in [incr tsdb()]) and a comparison between your baseline testsuite run and your final one for this lab (see Compare|Competence).

--General Stats

Analyze | Coverage
	Total Items: 194
	Positive Items: 122 
	Word String 0: 2.70
	Lexical Items 0: 4.07

	Negative Items: 72
	Word String 0: 2.89
	Lexical Items 0: 4.12
	Distinct Analyses: 1

	Overall Coverage: 1.4

Comparison ob baseline(gold) and final version of this lab

	Baseline
		lexical 0:  1.25
		analyses 0: 1.26
		in 0:       59.0
		out 0:      2.8

	New
		lexical 0:  1.35
		analyses 0: 1.36
		in 0:       73.0
		out 0:      1.4

These numbers point to two results: Frist the coverage of the grammar increased from 59% to 73%, which makes sense as several phenomenon that were in the testsuite can finally being displayed. Second, the overgeneration decreased, from 2.8% to 1.4%. Our grammar was previousely very precise due to the fact that we used relatively short sentences. We think that the major effect of this decrease is dut to the elimination of wrong parses that the grammar was generating before the added some restrictions to the head-subj/subj-head rule in combination with object-drop interprestation of some parses.
When inspecting the comparison of ill-formed sentences, we found 4 sentences. Three of them were not previously parsing because of their missing lexicon, but still would not generate a parse, because they represented ungrammatical sentences. This is a positive  result. Then the fourth sentence (#177) was previously parsing under the older grammar, but not now. The sentence is ungrammatical, as it displays the wrong use of an adjective on a pronoun. Therefore this evolution in the results is also correct. 
When inspecting the well-formed sentences, we had 32 sentences that had improvements. Five sentences that did not parse because lack of lexicon in a new grammatical feature (adjectival, adverbial constructions, prefix markings for possessives), were able to parse. 6 sentences double their number of parses because possessive juxtaposition was added to the grammar. 11 sentences got a parse for the first time, because we were able to add possessive prefixes to nouns. 3 sentences decreased their number of parses because we implemented a better use of head-sub/sub-head rules. 4 sentences increased their parses because the possessive juxtapostion of nouns works now. Two sentences increased their number of parses because of ambiguous readings the the sentential juxtaposition and the possessive prefixes allow.
These results reflect our expectations in the changes we did in the grammar this week.

VI. Describe briefly your test corpus, including: where you collected it, how many sentences it contains, and what format (transliterated, etc) it is in. The corpus was extracted from a thesis work from Judith Tonahauser: The Temporal Semantics of Noun Phrases: Evidence FROM Guarani. She presented an appendix with two stories told by a native speaker. We selected the story "A Bo, a Dog and a Frog", which was glossed and translated to English. We took the first 21 sentences of this story. Therefore all sentences are all continously followign one after the other. We formatted the senteces using the standard of our test suites. Here as an examples the first sentece in our corpus:

#Sentence.1
Source: a, attested
Vetted: t
Judgment: g
Phenomena: corpus
Oi᷉ndaje raka'e petei᷉ mita᷉ tyre'y᷉ ohayhuva mymbakuérape.
oiNndaje    rakaHe peteiN  mitaN  tyreHyN ohayhuva    mymbakueArape
o-iNndaje   rakaHe peteiN  mitaN  tyreHyN o-hayhu-va  mymba-kueAra pe
A.3-be.say  PAST   one     child  orphan  A3-love-RC  wild.animal-PL ACC
'There once was an orphan who loved animals.'

Each sentence is numbered separately. The orignal source is indexed as 'a', but mentioned in the corpus file. All the sentences are attested and vetted by a native speaker. Thefore we assume them to be grammatical.

The five sentences of the IGT represent: 	
1.- the natural use in the original orthography of the language
2.- the equivalent sentence after a morphological analysis and change of characters into our used ASCII 
3.- the sentence separating relevant affixes from each word
4.- the glosses and word-by-word translation of the sentence
5.- the general English translation of the sentence.

The glosses were revised to correspond to the glosses used in our grammar, and to reflect current standtards used in the field.
